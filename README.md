# untitled_llm_project_aug_2024
* Was thinking make a simple LLM based program to generate text and images for a simple picture book (think like a kid's book)
* Roughly thought it through and prototyped some parts but not pursuing at this time
* Think most of the work will be in polish/finish type work that I don't have much interest in right now
* Plus not the most original ideas
