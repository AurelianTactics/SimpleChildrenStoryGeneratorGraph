* Simple foundation model project
* Goal to prototype something simple to get more experience with LangGraph and related tools
* Based on a prompt, a writer agent generates a short childrens story.
    * The story is sent to an editor
    * The editor revises the story and sends to an artist
    * The artist generates an image
    * The critic reviews the work and either approves or sends back to the writer
* Interaction is a simple Gradio interface
